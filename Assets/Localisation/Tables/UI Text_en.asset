    m_Localized: 'Arcopa takes place in our real universe, it is ruled by the same
      laws : life, death, stars and planets that gravitate around. However, the planet
      Arcopa-8 is very different from Earth. This is a moon, orbiting around a gaseous
      giant named Sigma-B113. Its high GEO orbit means that half of the planet is
      perpetually in darkness.



      The outward side of the planet alternates
      between icy cold and extreme heat, which prevents life from developing there.



      Therefore,
      the part whose face is turned towards the planet is tempered, thanks to the
      protection provided by the gaseous giant. Life has been able to develop there
      richly whereas it is perpetually plunged into darkness. The only light that
      can be found there comes from its flora, which has developed bioluminescent
      properties.



      The environment is mainly chaotic with large forests,
      overhanging cliffs, caves and other rocky structures. Because of its orbit
      (whose position fluctuates between being surrounded by its planet, its star,
      and the void) there are many gravitational anomalies. They can manifest themselves
      by the presence of underground lakes and levitating waters.'
